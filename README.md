# Algorithms-and-data-structure-course

Template data structures in C++:
- queue (LiFo structure)
- deque (double ended queue)
- stack (FiFo structure)
- multistack
- unique stack (does not contain duplicates)
- ordered linked list
- priority_queue
- binary tree
- n-ary tree
- graph
- hash table

The following algorithms are implemented:
- Heap sort
- Algorithms related to data structures (implemented in the data structures files)
